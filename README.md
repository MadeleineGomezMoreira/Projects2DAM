### ABOUT ME:

> I'm a passionate student who's loved learning about computers since I was little. Once thing lead to another, and here I am, ready to learn more and more.

> While I'm not nearly an expert, I'm willing to give my all to be as fast and efficient as I can. The downside is I'm a bit of a perfectionist, though.
